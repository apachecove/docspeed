cross-platform java app for download, read and analyze Docsis configuration files.

Next update: no dependance over docsis.exe file anymore... hopefully!! So the cross-platform can be achieved... :)

I decided to retake this forgotten project since i've seen around a bit of demand to get the project so... i hopefully will release a new version in the next weeks... keep the support!!
